‚úçÔ∏è Tracing Pad

This project is an interactive, single-page web application designed to help beginners and children practice writing the Telugu alphabet (Aksharamala). Telugu is the primary focus language currently, but the app is built to support multiple languages in the future. It simulates a traditional blackboard or tracing pad, providing a fun and tactile digital environment for tracing both vowels (‡∞Ö‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å - Achulu) and consonants (‡∞π‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å - Hallulu).

The entire application is contained within a single HTML file, leveraging the Canvas API for drawing and Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling.

‚ú® Key Features
Blackboard Simulation: A visually appealing, responsive dark slate interface with a chalk-like drawing experience.

Complete Telugu Alphabet: Includes the full set of Telugu Vowels (‡∞Ö, ‡∞Ü, ‡∞á, etc.) and Consonants (‡∞ï, ‡∞ñ, ‡∞ó, etc.).

Categorized Selection: Easily switch between Achulu (Vowels) and Hallulu (Consonants) using dedicated buttons to open a character selection grid.

Guided Tracing: A faint, large guide character is displayed on the canvas to show the letter form.

Intuitive Navigation: Use the left and right arrow buttons to quickly cycle through the characters sequentially.

Clear Function: A prominent "Clear Slate" button to instantly wipe the canvas and reset the tracing area for a new attempt.

Mobile-Friendly: Fully responsive design ensures the tracing pad works perfectly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, supporting both touch and mouse interactions.

üöÄ How to Use
Start Tracing: The application loads on the first character of the Vowels list (‡∞Ö). Use your mouse (click and drag) or finger (tap and drag) on the dark canvas to trace the letter.

Clear the Slate: Click the Red Rotate Icon in the top-right corner of the slate to clear your drawing.

Change Category: Click on either the "‡∞Ö‡∞ö‡±ç‡∞ö‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å - Achulu" or "‡∞π‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å - Hallulu" button above the canvas to open the Character Selector modal.

Select a Letter: In the modal, click on any Telugu character to instantly load it onto the slate.

Navigate: Use the Blue Left and Right Arrow buttons on the side of the canvas to move to the previous or next character in the current sequence.

üõ† Technology Stack
This project is built using minimal dependencies, making it fast and easy to deploy:

HTML5: Structure and content.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Core logic, Canvas drawing handlers, and state management.

Canvas API: Used for the interactive tracing functionality, allowing for responsive, freehand drawing.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework for all styling and responsiveness.

üí° Future Enhancements (Suggestions)
The following features could enhance the learning experience:

Audio Pronunciation: Integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS) to play the correct pronunciation of the currently displayed character.

Color Picker: Allow users to change the chalk color.

Erase Tool: Implement an "eraser" function to remove parts of the drawing without clearing the entire slate.

Tracing Path Guides: Programmatically show stroke order/direction on the guide character for better learning.

Language Expansion: Expansion to include tracing guides for other languages, starting with English and Hindi.
